# Reports
Here are some tests I ran on the final model and the results:

Rainbow Test: 0.3694693388777271
Rainbow P-Value: 0.9999999999999999

This rainbow test shows the model did not meet linear assumptions

F Statistic P-Value: 0.00

JB P-Value: 0.00

Lagrange Multiplier P-Value: 1.026 e-22

All of these tests showed that the linear model did not meet the assumptions

VIF Test showed values below 5 so this was a test that passed

# Conclusion
Effort was made to maximize how well the model could satisfy the assumptions. Fundamentally, the highest correlation that the data had was very weak(less than 0.3). Since the data had such a statistically insignificant relationship with the data, it was fully expected that the model would not meet assumptions yet we were able to gain at least some minor insight into the data because of it.
